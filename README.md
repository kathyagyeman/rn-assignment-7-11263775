## Design choices:
### React Navigation: 
I used react navigation to implement a drawer-based navigation system. This allows users to easily access different sections of the app through a side menu, enhancing usability and organization.

## Data Storage Implementation:
### AsyncStorage
 AsyncStorage from React Native was used for  storage. This allows the app to store key-value pairs locally on the device, ensuring that important data is preserved between sessions.
